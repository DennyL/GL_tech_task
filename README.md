#### Structure:
src/json_files - contains the json file for parsing

src/tests - contains a python file with code for solving the task.

The code uses a relative path to the json file, which can be adjusted if necessary.
The code runs three functions, each of which solves a dedicated part of the task, and can be run separately.
